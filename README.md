# Packer Vagrant boxes for AEM

## Overview

This project maintains my definitions of packer builds for my other projects.

The boxes in _vagrant-aem_ are (or will be) used as options in the [vagrant-aem](https://github.com/bstopp/vagrant-aem) project.

The boxes in the _puppet-test-vms_ folder are used for testing the [Puppet AEM](https://github.com/bstopp/puppet-aem) module. The PuppetLabs one aren't always up-to-date with VirtualBox additions.

Credit goes to [shiguredo/packer-templates](https://github.com/shiguredo/packer-templates) and PuppetLab's own [templates](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-packer) because without those examples, this wouldn't exist.
