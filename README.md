# Packer Vagrant boxes for AEM

## Overview

This project maintains my definitions of packer builds for my other projects. These packer templates are (or will be) use as options in the [vagrant-aem](https://github.com/bstopp/vagrant-aem) project.

These aren't much different than the PuppetLabs *nocm* boxes, however they do have larger disk definitions, and hardware support for multiple CPUs.

Credit goes to [shiguredo/packer-templates](https://github.com/shiguredo/packer-templates) because without those examples, this wouldn't exist.
